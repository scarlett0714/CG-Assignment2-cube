# Assignment 2 - Compilation Guide

Prerequisites
Before compiling the project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Qt Creator (Recommended version: Qt 6.x or Qt 5.x)
Qt SDK (with necessary modules)
C++ Compiler (e.g., MSVC, MinGW, or Clang)
CMake (if using CMake-based build)


üõ†Ô∏è Build Instructions
Follow these steps to successfully compile and run the project:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name/project.git
cd project

2Ô∏è‚É£ Open the Project in Qt Creator
Launch Qt Creator
Click File ‚Üí Open Project...
Select the .pro file (if using qmake) or CMakeLists.txt file (if using CMake)
Configure the project with the appropriate kit (e.g., Qt 6.2 + MinGW)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure Build Settings
Go to Projects (Ctrl+5) ‚Üí Build & Run
Choose a build kit (e.g., Desktop Qt 6.2.2 MinGW 64-bit)
Set the build directory (./build or ./out recommended)
Make sure Shadow Build is enabled (recommended)

4Ô∏è‚É£ Build the Project
Click Build ‚Üí Build All (Ctrl+B)
Alternatively, use the terminal inside Qt Creator:
qmake && make -j$(nproc)
or for CMake-based projects:
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .

5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Application
Click Run (Ctrl+R) in Qt Creator
Or run the compiled binary manually:
./build/your_project_name

üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
If you see missing DLL errors, make sure Qt runtime libraries are included. Use:
windeployqt your_project.exe  # Windows
macdeployqt your_project.app  # macOS
If compilation fails, check the Build Output tab in Qt Creator.
Ensure the correct Qt version and compiler are selected in Build Settings.
